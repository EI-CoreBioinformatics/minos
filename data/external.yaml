pick:
  #  Parameters related to the Mikado pick stage.
  #  - alternative_splicing: Parameters related to which AS events to consider as
  #  valid during picking.
  #  - chimera_split: parameters related to splitting of transcripts in the presence
  #  of multiple ORFs
  #  - files: input and output files
  #  - run_options: generic options related to the run, eg number of processors to
  #  use.
  #  - scoring_file: a scoring file for the analysis. Default: plants.yaml.
  alternative_splicing:
    #  Parameters related to alternative splicing reporting.
    #  - report: whether to report at all or not the AS events.
    #  - max_isoforms: Maximum number of isoforms per locus. 1 implies no AS reported.
    #  Default: 3
    #  - only_confirmed_introns: bring back AS events only when their introns are
    #  either
    #   present in the primary transcript or in the set of confirmed introns.

  files:
    #  Input and output files for Mikado pick.
    #  - gff: input GTF/GFF3 file. Default: mikado_prepared.gtf
    #  - loci_out: output GFF3 file from Mikado pick. Default: mikado.loci.gff3
    #  - subloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate subloci. Default: no
    #  output
    #  - monoloci_out: optional GFF file with the intermediate monoloci. Default:
    #  no output
    #  - log: log file for this step.

  run_options:
    #  Generic run options.
    #  - procs: number of processes to use. Default: 1
    #  - intron_range: A range where most of the introns (99%) should fall into. Transcripts
    #  with too many
    #   introns larger or smaller than what is defined in this range will be penalised
    #   in the scoring. Default: [60, 900]
    #  - preload: boolean flag. If set, the whole database will be preloaded into
    #  memory for potentially faster access.
    #  - single_thread: boolean flag. If set, multithreading will be disabled - useful
    #  for profiling and debugging.
    #  - flank: DEPRECATED. Now set in the clustering section.
